**Method 1**

This is a relatively straightforward problem. We know that no draws are allowed, and we are looking to solve for the probability of playing 7 games. In order to reach 7 games we need the two teams to be equal after 6 games. Each team must then have 3 wins and 3 losses. So, the question becomes how many times can we choose 3 wins from 6 games, and the number of total outcomes in 6 games.

$\binom{6}{3} =$  6 games choose 3, which will give us the number of ways a team can win 3 games.

$2^6=$ number of possible out comes for 6 played games. Think about in this way: If played two games we could have this sample space [T1W,T1W], [T2W,T2W], [T1W,T2W], [T2W,T1W] = 4 possible outcomes. 

**Solution 1:**

$$
\frac{\binom{6}{3}}{2^6} = \frac{20}{64}= 0.3125
$$

**Method 2**

We also know that it is a discrete probability distribution with a fixed probability of 0.5 win/loss per game since they are independent of each other. 

Using the binomial theorem we can express this as:

$$
\binom{n}{k} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-k} = \binom{6}{3} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{6-3} = 20 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6 = 0.3125
$$

**Both methods come to the same conclusion:** Thereâ€™s a 31.25% chance we get to a 7th game!
